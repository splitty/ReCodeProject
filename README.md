# ReCode Project
  Ramp-up project for creative programming 3 written in Processing3.

### What is it?
 
 This project is the first assignment in CP3, where we were tasked with re-coding an old piece of computer art.  I decided to grab an old art image from the recode project, found at [http://recodeproject.com/](http://recodeproject.com/).
 
 The specific image I used for reference can be found [here](http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v1n2digital-computer-based-sculpture-composed-of-coloured-elements) and is a part of the 1976 magazine Computer Graphics and Art: volume 1 that can be viewed [here](https://github.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/matthewepler/ReCode_Project/COMPUTER_GRAPHICS_AND_ART_May1976.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA5BA2674WEWV2CIOD%2F20210210%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20210210T155959Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=d60f1de171545a892dc3e3be57c986bb06b2677d1090422f723df63102ab8673).
